                    The Mountain Vista TSA Chapter is one of the most successful in the state, winning ten out of forty-five events in last year’s state competition, and making Mountain Vista the first Douglas County school to win the state finals. Two of these teams, those for Open Source Software and Webmaster, won second place in the national competition in Washington D.C.
                    <br>
                    <br>Fifty-three Mountain Vista students competed in state that year (nearly half qualifying for nationals), and with an even bigger club this year, they are poised to do it again. The chapter is led by President Anirudh Mathukumilli and his stellar officer core, seasoned veterans all. The other members of TSA are also high achievers, and with their smarts, their work ethic, and their sheer numbers, the Mountain Vista chapter is guaranteed to be one of the most successful in the state.

                    And now, having seen our specific chapter, let’s look at the organization as a whole. What are the benefits of joining the Technology Student Association? To quote the <a href="http://www.tsaweb.org/" target="_blank">official website,</a> <em>"the Technology Student Association fosters personal growth, leadership, and opportunities in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM); members apply and integrate these concepts through co-curricular activities, competitions, and related programs." </em> &nbsp;That’s a bit of a mouthful. In a nutshell, TSA exists to get kids interested in science and engineering. With over <b>200,000</b> members and <b>2500</b> teachers nationwide, in more than <b>two thousand</b> high schools from Hawaii to Maine, TSA is one of the biggest organizations of its kind, and is one of the driving factors in preparing high schoolers for participation in today’s technical workforce. They also provide engineering experience to oft-neglected minorities and women, who make up <b>39%</b> of the TSA membership. Finally, TSA provides better educational help, with <b>75%</b> of members graduating college, and almost every member graduating high school.
