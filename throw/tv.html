            <p>Best Buy accepts some TVs after a purchase. To confirm that your tv is eligible contact the nearest Best Buy. Local cities may offer recycling programs and in Highlands Ranch the quarterly electronics recycling accepts tvs for a low cost. Junk Genius picks up tvs for a fee. Some older tvs can not be recycled through these programs and companies and may require additional research to find a local way to dispose of these electronics.
