            <p>Highlands Ranch offers a computer and electronics recycling program usually once a quarter. This program charges a small fee to drop off all kinds of old electronics including computers and TVs. This is one of the easiest ways but companies that accept computers include Best Buy and Staples but for some items you must purchase one of their products first. Some cities offer their own electronics program but their constraints may change often so check with your local city.
